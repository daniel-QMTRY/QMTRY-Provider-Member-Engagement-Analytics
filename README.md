Boom—seamless, scalable, and seriously fun! 🚀

## 📈 Indices & Measures — Transparent, Defensible, and Dazzling! 🌟

We don't hide the math; we flaunt it! Check this pie chart for the Member Engagement Index (MEI)—weights that make sense and drive decisions:

```mermaid
pie title Member Engagement Index (MEI) Weights – Your Secret Sauce!
  "Medication Adherence (PDC)" : 40
  "Preventive Compliance (SUPD, HBD, CBP, Screenings)" : 25
  "Outreach Responsiveness" : 20
  "Continuity of Care (PCP Stability & Cadence)" : 15
```

Core Measures (Demo Edition – Exec-Approved Simplicity):
- **CBP Control** 🩸: Last SBP < 140 and DBP < 90 (HTN cohort). Hypertension? Handled!
- **HBD Control** 🍬: Last A1c < 9 (DM cohort). Diabetes drama? Diminished!
- **SUPD** 💊: Statin use in DM cohort. Prevention party starts here!
- **PDC** 📅: Adherent days ÷ window (first fill to year-end), overlap-capped at 0.80 threshold. Adherence? Amped up!

Every formula, weight, and derivation? Zipped in the Evidence Bundle for your auditors' delight. No smoke, just mirrors... of transparency! 😎

And for trends? Imagine this bar chart showing PDC lift over time (sample data vibes—run the demo for real sparks!):

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    title "PDC Adherence Trends - Watch the Wins Stack!"
    x-axis ["Statins", "RASA", "Diabetes Meds"]
    y-axis "Percentage" 0 --> 100
    bar [75, 82, 68]
    bar [85, 90, 78]
```

Green bars = growth! Your execs will be charting high-fives. 📊🎉
